  <h2>Background</h2>
    The shiba inu was thought to be used for hunting in Japan as far back as 300 B.C. Many believe that the breed was used to hunt birds and occasionally wild boar.
    The name "Shiba" means small but some think that it also refers to brushwood which is reference to the dog's redish coat.
    There used to be three kinds of shiba's that included the Shinshu Shiba, the Sanin Shiba, and the Mino Shiba.
    During WW2 the dog 's existence almost went extinct so the Japanese decided to interbreed them to save the species.
    The breed was taken to the United States in 1950 but only gained popularity by the 1990's.</p>

    <h2>Care</h2>
    Shibas shed a lot, some owners say that these dogs shed for 6 months at a time.
    To help keep your house clean remember to frequently brush them.The shiba's coat does not mat, unless they are a "long coat."
    Shibas are fairly energetic but will not be really effected if not taken on a walk daily.They are not going to cause a reckus if left alone at the house
    but should be trained to be in a cage. Shibas should not be trusted off the leash because they will be gone forever.
    The most commmon health condition in Shibas are allergies but may also have problems with hip dysplasia, eye disorders, and patella luxation.</p>
